# UnityUserInterface
User Interface stuff that can hopefully be used in other projects.  Started with just a knob.

This Unity project came from following the YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRKJdUAWn5A).  It is a pleasant tutorial to follow because it goes at the pace of the creator and does not have any speaking.  If the pace is too fast for some, you can just slow it down or pause where you need more clarification.

I did not do everything that the tutorial creator did.  My graphics are not the same.  I took a knob from a selection page at [istockphoto](https://www.istockphoto.com/photos/volume-knob?mediatype=photography&phrase=volume%20knob&sort=mostpopular).  I modified the picture to just get the knob.  I did not do the cool indicator stuff.

## Modifications
One of the modifications I did (relative to the tutorial) was to move the whole knob instead of just the indicator.  It made sense due to the knob image that I used.

The other big modification I did was to have the knob go a full 360 degrees.  I wanted this type of knob rather than one that is limited.  There are notes in the CircleSlider.cs comments if anybody wants to limit the rotation of the knob.  I tend to comment my code extensively.  Mostly for myself, but hopefully others who might use the code gain benefits as well.
